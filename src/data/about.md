Hello ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mate an Astro Theme which is focus on simplicity and extensibility. It's build with Astro, [Daisy UI](https://daisyui.com/) (Tailwind CSS plugin) and [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/).

The starter will give you 4 sections (it's really easy to add more if you want ðŸ˜ƒ):

- [Landing:](#home) Displays a nice greeting with your name, also your roles (what you are) and all your social links.
- [About:](#about) Show the about section where you can write about who you are, what you like to do, etc. Also you can add a photo next to it!
- [Project:](#projects) Displays a card for all your project that you've made and also the possibility to link with github or and external link.
