        Hello 👋 I'm Mate a gatsby starter which is focus on simplicity and
        extensibility. It's build with Gatsby(duh), Rebass (styled-component
        system) and Contentful.
      </p>
      <p class='py-6'>
        The starter will give you 4 sections (it's really easy to add more if
        you want 😃):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Landing: Displays a nice greeting with your name, also your roles
          (what you are) and all your social links.
        </li>
        <li>
          About: Show the about section where you can write about who you are,
          what you like to do, etc. Also you can add a photo next to it!
        </li>
        <li>
          Project: Displays a card for all your project that you've made and
          also the posibility to link with github or and external link.
        </li>
        <li>
          Writing: Take the information about your medium user and show up to 6
          stories as cards with the link to Medium.
        </li>
      </ul>
